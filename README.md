### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jakub from Poland, and I'm a fullstack JS developer. I really enjoy learning new stuff and I guess I'm able to do it quite fast. I spend major part of my time on working with NodeJS frameworks, like Express or Nest (just a little bit) with TypeScript, I'm also working on frontend project which uses Vue with CSS preprocessors like SASS, using BEM methodology.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning writing smart contracts in Solidity
